        question: 'Will the salesperson bring every catalogue with him?',
        answer:
          'As we have thousands of fabrics, it would be very difficult to carry everything (not to mention the space required and time needed to go through them all). So the teams carry 20-30 of our best selling collections to simplify things for you.',

        question:
          'If I decide to go ahead, how can I be sure of on time delivery and my money is safe?',

      },
      {
        question: "Ok, I'm sold. What next?",

      },
      {
        question: 'What is the maximum size window I can go to?',
        answer: `There really is no limit for curtains. Installing a 10m by 10m curtain is not an issue at all. For blinds, there are some limitations. For example, if you had quite a big wooden venetian blind, it would be very difficult to operate. Roller blinds can be up to a maximum width of 3m. We can make them bigger but would advise it on a case by case situation.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer any 100% linen fabrics?',
        answer: `Although we offer natural fabrics like linen and cotton, usually there is some content of polyester as well.

      {
        question:
          'What will you require from my side to ensure a smooth installation?',
        answer:
          'Your job is to sit back and relax. However, before we can begin installation, you need to ensure that the area is clear and there is power to the property. Also, if any permits are required by building or community management, this must be obtained in advance. Feel free to contact us if you need any documents from our side to support your application.',

        question: 'Is it possible to achieve total Blackout?',
        answer:
          'In some cases yes and in other cases we can achieve a very high level of darkness but maybe not 100%. There are variants like ceiling level, floor level, even if the glass is all the way to the ceiling, diffused light can seep in from the top. As professionals, we can adjust and improve as much as possible, but you have to bear in mind that sometimes, the laws of physics are against us.',

        question: 'What are your prices like?',

          'Being very honest, we’re not the cheapest out there nor are we the most expensive. What we do offer is excellent products, unbeatable after sales care and a fantastic warranty.

      },
      {
        question:
          'Why did I get a different price on your website yet the person visiting gave me a different price?',
        answer:
          'The prices shown on our website are based on the sizes entered and entry-level fabrics. If the actual required sizes are bigger and you opted for a higher price fabric, then there will be an increase in price.
